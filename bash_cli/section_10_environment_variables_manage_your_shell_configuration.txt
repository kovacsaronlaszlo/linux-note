shell environment is a collection if settings, variables, aliases and configurations
it defines the context in which our programs are run
it thus influences how our programs are being run


what is shell?
# outer layer if the operating system
# it takes commands from the user and translates them into a form that the kernel can understand
# it can also display the result of those commands to the user

# in general:
    > everything that allows th outer world to access the operating system
    > the graphical user interface is always a shell

# command line (shell)
    > the term "shell" only refer to the command line interface (CLI) os an operating system
    > CLI: a text-base interface that allows users to interact with system by typing commands

# thus, "linux shell":
    > this usully only refers to the CLI / "terminal" / "console"

# the linux shell:
    > allows us to work on devices that dont support a graphical user interface (GUI)
    > quite often, its more efficient to use the cli instead of the gui

============================================

using environment variables
# what are environment variable:
    > used to store configuration and settings
    > influence the shell and program behavior

# environment variables are written in uppercase letters
# list variables: 
    - env
# example (to be prefered):
    - echo "${PWD}"
    - echo "${USER}"
    - echo "${PATH}"
# also use:
    - echo "$PATH"
# avoid this:
    - echo $PATH

============================================

Important environment variables:
HOME, PWD, USER

# HOME:
    > stores current users home directory path

# PWD:
    > stores the current working dorectory path
    > for the last directory befor: OLDPWD
    > not to be confused with the command "pwd"!
    > to navigate back the previous directory: cd "${OLDPWD}"

# USER:
    > stores the current users username

============================================

how to set/unset environment variables
# we can use the esport command to create an environment variable:
    > export VAR=value
    > ' means rewrite env variable
# can also overwrite existing variable
    > VAR=new-value

# delete an env varaible
    > unset VAR
    > this is useful for troublechooting and cleaning up of the env
