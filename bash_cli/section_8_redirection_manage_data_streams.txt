write output to a file
how do we get the output into a file?
how can we redirect the output into a file?
# can do this with the ">" operator
# example:
    echo "bash is amazing" > file.txt
    ls ../../bash_cli/ > bach_folder.txt
# to append to file, can use ">>" instead of ">"
# example:
    cat bash_folder.txt >> file.txt
    echo "+++++" >> file.txt
    du -h bach_folder.txt >> file.txt
# if there is some problem with the file or command we want to use it will throw an error

============================================

standard stream: stdin, stdout, stderr
# by default, there are 3 communication channel for data:
    > 0: standard input (from the keyboard): stdin
    > 1: standard output (on screen): stdout
    > 2: standard error output (on the screen): stderr

# so what does ">" or ">>" do?
    > by using ">" or ">>", we can redirect the stdout to a file
    > thus, the stdout is no longer being sent to the terminal, but to a file
    > example:
        du -h file.txt file1.txt // stdin
        4.0K	file.txt // stdout
        du: cannot access 'file1.txt': No such file or directory // stderr
