what is a pipe ("|")?
# the pipe is  amechanism that passes the output of one command as input to another command
# this, you can chain multiple commands together and build more compley functionalities
    > general syntax: command | command | ... | command
    > example:
        - ls | wc -l
        - ls | cat
        - du -h file1.txt file-not-exist.txt 2>&1 > /dev/null | wc -l

============================================

Dual output: the Utility "tee"
commonly used tool: tee
# with the combination of a pipe and the"tee" command you can create a standard output and write it to a file at the same time
# example:
    > echo "hello world" | tee hello.txt // create and add the "hello world" to the hello.txt, than write is out to the terminal
    > to append the file: echo "hello world" | tee -a hello.txt
    > other example:
        - echo "hello world" | tee -a hello.txt | wc -c // print the number of characters of the file (which we add to the file)
        - ping google.com 2>&1 | tee ping.txt // write the outputs of the ping into ping.txt

============================================

Commonly used tools: sort, uniq
# sort
    > sort the contents in a file or stdin
        - by default alphabetical order
        - sort -r: sort in reverse alphabetical order
        - sort -n: sort numbers according to numerical order
        - sort -c: check whether the contents in a file are sorted and find unsorted elements
        - sort -k <column_number> (starting at 1): sort data by a specific solumn
    > example:
        - cat users.txt | sort
        - cat users.txt | sort -r
        - cat users.txt | sort -k 2

# uniq
    > remove duplicate lines: 
        - sort users.txt | uniq
        - first have to sort the list, than use the uniq command
    > there is a sorter way:
        - sort -u users.txt
        or
        - cat users.txt | sort -u
    > find the duplicate lines in a file:
        - sort users.txt | uniq -d
        or 
        - cat users.txt | sort | uniq -d
