what is a pipe ("|")?
# the pipe is  amechanism that passes the output of one command as input to another command
# this, you can chain multiple commands together and build more compley functionalities
    > general syntax: command | command | ... | command
    > example:
        - ls | wc -l
        - ls | cat
        - du -h file1.txt file-not-exist.txt 2>&1 > /dev/null | wc -l

============================================

Dual output: the Utility "tee"
commonly used tool: tee
# with the combination of a pipe and the"tee" command you can create a standard output and write it to a file at the same time
# example:
    > echo "hello world" | tee hello.txt // create and add the "hello world" to the hello.txt, than write is out to the terminal
    > to append the file: echo "hello world" | tee -a hello.txt
    > other example:
        - echo "hello world" | tee -a hello.txt | wc -c // print the number of characters of the file (which we add to the file)
        - ping google.com 2>&1 | tee ping.txt // write the outputs of the ping into ping.txt
