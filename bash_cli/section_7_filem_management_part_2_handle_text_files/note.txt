how to read files:
> cat
    # allows to print the contents of the file
    # example: 
        cat data.txt
        cat b*
        cat img.jpeg - read binary data of image
        ...etc.
    # but not enough to display files

> head
    # show us the start of a (text) file
    # we can specify the paramter -n for the number of lines (default is 10)
    # example: head -n 5 data.txt

> tail 
    # read a file from the end
    # same options as "head"
    # example: tail -n 5 data.txt
