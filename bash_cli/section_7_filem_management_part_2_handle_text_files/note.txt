how to read files:
> cat
    # allows to print the contents of the file
    # example: 
        cat data.txt
        cat b*
        cat img.jpeg - read binary data of image
        ...etc.
    # but not enough to display files

> head
    # show us the start of a (text) file
    # we can specify the paramter -n for the number of lines (default is 10)
    # example: head -n 5 data.txt

> tail 
    # read a file from the end
    # same options as "head"
    # example: tail -n 5 data.txt


============================================


> less
    # allows us to read large files
    # we can use the arrow keys to navigate through the file
    # can use f (forward) and b (backward) to navigate a whole page ahead or back
    # can also navigate to a percentage of our content
        - just enter 50p to navigate to 50% of our content
    # can use the = to show info about our current position
    # can alsu use the Option -N display row numbers
    # find in file:
        - forward search /<search_term>
        - backward search: ?<search_term>
    # use "q" to exit from file

how to get the size of a file

> if we just cat a large file... the whole file will be printed in the terminal
> this make quite long... cant we check of a file ahead of time?
    # wc (word count) default program in unix, if dont have, install it
        - example:
            wc file.txt
            wc -lwc file.txt
                => this command prints aout the number of lines, words and bytes in the file
            wc -l file.txt
                => counts the number of lines
            wc -w file.txt
                => counts the number of words
            wc -c file.txt
                => counts the number of bytes (=8bit ASCII characters)

    # du (disk usage)
        - it will calcuate the size of all items in the folder
        - we can also specify the paramter "-s", to just get a summary

how to edit files
> there s no build-in text editor for bash
> have to install aditional software for that
> 4 quite popular options are:
    # pico / nano: A simple editor for text files in bash
    # vi / vim: a more advanced text editor
> install process depends on the system you are using:
    # mac:
        brew install nano
    # ubuntu:
        apt-get update
        apt-get install -y nano
    # fedora
        dnf update
        dnf install -y nano
> example: nano bash.txt 
    # if the file is not created yet, the nano will do
