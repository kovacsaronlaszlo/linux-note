how to read files:
> cat
    # allows to print the contents of the file
    # example: 
        cat data.txt
        cat b*
        cat img.jpeg - read binary data of image
        ...etc.
    # but not enough to display files

> head
    # show us the start of a (text) file
    # we can specify the paramter -n for the number of lines (default is 10)
    # example: head -n 5 data.txt

> tail 
    # read a file from the end
    # same options as "head"
    # example: tail -n 5 data.txt


============================================


> less
    # allows us to read large files
    # we can use the arrow keys to navigate through the file
    # can use f (forward) and b (backward) to navigate a whole page ahead or back
    # can also navigate to a percentage of our content
        - just enter 50p to navigate to 50% of our content
    # can use the = to show info about our current position
    # can alsu use the Option -N display row numbers
    # find in file:
        - forward search /<search_term>
        - backward search: ?<search_term>
    # use "q" to exit from file
