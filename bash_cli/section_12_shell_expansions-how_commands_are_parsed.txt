Filename expansion
# shell expansion:
	> before executing, the shell "rewrites" and parses the command
	> this happens before the command is being executed

# filename expansion	
	> ls *
	> in this case, the * is being "expanded"
	> for the asterisk, this mean Bash gets the contents of the current directory
	> and passes those items as paramteres to the "ls" command
	> this command print the content of our current folder:
		echo *
	> we can also filter the files that Bash should find for us:
		example:
			- echo *.txt (filter multiple character end with .txt)
			- echo ?.txt (filter one character end with .txt)

============================================

Tilde expansion
# tilde expansion:
	> ls ~
	> this list our home folder
	> by the "~" character, we're using the tilde expansion
	> this character is being expanded to the value of the environment variable HOME
	> test this:
		$ echo ~
	> we could also use it with a plus:
		~+: expands to $PWD
		$ echo ~+
