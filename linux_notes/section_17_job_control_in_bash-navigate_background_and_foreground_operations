background jobs in bash

what is job?
# a job is a command that is being executed
# a job can consist out of multiple programs:
	> cat file.txt | wc
	> in this casw, wehave 2 programs that are being executed at the same time:
	  cat and wc
	> both of those programs are bundled into one job that is being executed
# so far:
	> foreground jobs:
		>> we have looked at foreground jobs
		>> those occupy our shell: bash will wait for its completion before
		   accepting a new command

background jobs in bash
# we can also start background jobs in bash:
	> [command] &
	> example:
		$ ping -c 10 google.com &
		> the -c option limits the number of ping packets to 10
	> because of the "&" symbol, the command will be started as a background job
	> the output will still be displayed in the shell
	  (unless we redirect it)
	> it will display the job ID and the process ID
