Package management centos

# Lot of similarity of ubuntu package management (section 18)
# Simplified package flow
	> fedora -> centos stream -> RHEL
# Red Hat Enterprise Linux
	> centos stream is a rolling preview of RHEL
	> thus, package managmenet should behave extremly similar
	> less potential issues in RHEL

===================================

The .rpm package format

# .rpm without package manager:
	> .rpm are archive that contain all the files & configuration
	  required to install a software
	> we could dowload .rpm files manually, for example from:
		>> https://mirror.stream.centos.org/
		>> download an .rpm package from the link above
		$ cd Dowloads
		$ du -s zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		4032	zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		>> we should usually avoid this, as it can easily lead to conflict
	> We can then inspect the .rpm file:
		>> rpm -gpl [file].rpm
		$ rpm -gpl zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		...
		(list of files will be installed to our system would be install this file)
		$ rpm --help
		(doc wich tell us how to use the rpm program)
		>> -q (--group): verify package(s) in group
		>> -p (--package): verify a package file
		>> -l (--list): list files in package
		$ rpm -g -p -l zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		...
		(we get the same list above)
	> or install the .rpm file manually:
		>> rpm -i [file].rpm
		$ rpm -i zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		error: ... /var/lib/rpm/.rpm.lock (Permission denide)
		$ sudo rpm -i zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
		[sudo] password for root: 
		$ sudo rpm -i zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm
			package zsh-<version>.<processor-type>.rpm is already installed
	> to uninstall package:
		>> rpm -e [package]
		$ sudo rpm -e zsh
		(but the dependencies might cannot be resolved)
