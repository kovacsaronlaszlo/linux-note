Package management centos

# Lot of similarity of ubuntu package management (section 18)
# Simplified package flow
	> fedora -> centos stream -> RHEL
# Red Hat Enterprise Linux
	> centos stream is a rolling preview of RHEL
	> thus, package managmenet should behave extremly similar
	> less potential issues in RHEL
