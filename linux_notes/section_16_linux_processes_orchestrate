Important [CentOS]: Note for CentOS Users

Important note for CentOS users:

In this chapter, we will be installing several additional software to visualize 
the concept of processes.

In order to be able to use those, you need to be able to access 
additional packages (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux) on your system. For this, you need to make sure epel-release is installed on your system:

"sudo yum install epel-release"

You can then install all the tools you need for this chapter with the following command:

"sudo yum install wget htop"

==================================

how do processes work?
# process:
	> an instance of a progam
	> independent execution unit with its own resources:
		>> CPU & MEmory resources
		>> opened files, network connections...
	> it is managed by the kernel (lowest level of the operating system)
	> each process has:
		> process ID (pid)
		> a user under which  this process runs under
		> a state (running, waiting, stopped, zombie)
		> all process are organized in a hierachy!
