================================================

dpkg: debian package manager
# On the lowest level, "dpkg" is responsible for installing software packages

# Those packages are distributed as .deb files, and we can install
# them through dpkg:
	> dpkg -i pacakge.deb

# A .deb file is a compressed archive (ar file format) with all the
# files needed for the program, and its installation on the system

# How do we get those software packages?
	> automatically
	> manually
# check the system:
	$ lsb_release -a
