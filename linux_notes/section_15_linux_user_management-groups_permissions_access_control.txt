how do users in linux work?
# different kind of users (main 3):
	> root user:
		- highest privileges
		- it has the user ID: 0
		- there can only be one root on the system
	> regular users:
		- limited privileges
		- we can allow regular users to temoprarily get toot access through sudo
	> service users:
		- for specific tasks
		- this allows us to safely run a webserver, database...
# groups:
	- all users have a primary group
	- can be assigned to zero to unlimited additional groups

managing users
# on linux, user information is stored in various files:
	> /etc/passwd
		- contains basic user account information
		- username, user ID (UID), group ID (GID), user description (full name),
		  home directory and default shell
		- readable by all users
	> /etc/shadow
		- stores encrypted user password and passwoord aging information
		- also stores additional information, such as the date of the
		  last password changes, expiry dates...
		- readable only by the root users (or users with root privileges)
	> /etc/group
		- contains information about the groups, and their members
		- readable by all users
